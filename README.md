# Zenith Interactive Web Project
I create this for fun project while practicing tailwind css and vue js in web development, this website is still on development so many things i have to do to perfect it. I will make a list for major update and some update to fix bug or or tidy up some elements on the website.

This website is currently made by myself, inspired with Wuthering Waves landing page. Some element may be similar from that page but I won't claim it as myself, all copyrights owned by Kuro Games as an original devs.
